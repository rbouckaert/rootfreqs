## RootFreqs

[BEAST 2](http://beast2.org) package for specifying equilibrium (root) frequencies 
that differ from frequencies provided by the site model.
A sequence can be specified to define a different distribution at each site. 
This can be useful for example when a root sequence is known.

The package should work with the following features:

* gamma rate heterogeneity
* proportion invariable sites
* BEAGLE
* ascertainment correction
* ambiguous sites at tips and/or at root
* uncertain sites at tips and/or at root
* threaded likelihood calculation
